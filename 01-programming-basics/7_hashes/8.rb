# NoMethodError: undefined method `keys' for Array

# A. We're missing keys in an array variable.
# Not applicable becayse array has only index, no key.

# B. There is no method called keys for Array objects.
# Correct, because arrays have index.

# C. keys is an Array object, but it hasn't been defined yet.
# Error clearly says method 

# D. There's an array of strings, and we're trying to get the string keys out of the array, but it doesn't exist.
# Again, method defined here.
