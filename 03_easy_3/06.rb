# The || operator returns a truthy value if either or both of its operands are truthy, a falsey value if both operands are falsey. The && operator returns a truthy value if both of its operands are truthy, and a falsey value if either operand is falsey. This works great until you need only one of two conditions to be truthy, the so-called exclusive or.

# In this exercise, you will write a method named xor that takes two arguments, and returns true if exactly one of its arguments is truthy, false otherwise.

# problem
# take two boolean values as input
# check if true and false, or false and true.

# algorithm
# return (true and false) || (false and true)
